This Hugging Face Space demonstrates a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a loan application being approved. The model was trained on a [mention dataset source if public, e.g., a Kaggle dataset or a general description like "a financial dataset"].

The interface is built using **Gradio**.

## How it Works

The application takes several features of a loan applicant as input and uses a pre-trained **Random Forest Classifier** (or specify your chosen model) to predict if the loan will be 'Approved' or 'Not Approved'.

The model was developed through a process involving:
*   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*   Data Cleaning (handling missing values, outliers)
*   Feature Engineering (encoding categorical variables, scaling)
*   Model Training and Selection

## How to Use This Space

1.  **Input Applicant Details:** Fill in the required fields in the Gradio interface. These typically include:
    *   Gender
    *   Marital Status
    *   Number of Dependents
    *   Education Level (Graduate/Not Graduate)
    *   Self-Employed (Yes/No)
    *   Applicant Income
    *   Co-applicant Income
    *   Loan Amount
    *   Loan Amount Term (in months)
    *   Credit History (1 for good, 0 for bad)
    *   Property Area (Urban/Semi-Urban/Rural)
    *(Adjust this list based on the actual inputs your Gradio app takes)*

2.  **Submit:** Click the "Predict" (or "Submit") button.

3.  **View Prediction:** The model will output its prediction: "Loan Approved" or "Loan Not Approved", possibly with a confidence score if your Gradio app provides it.

## Model Details

*   **Model Type:** Random Forest Classifier (or your specific model)
*   **Key Preprocessing Steps:**
    *   Missing value imputation (Mode for categorical, Mean for numerical)
    *   One-hot encoding for categorical features
    *   Outlier handling using IQR
    *   Square root transformation for certain numerical features
    *   Min-Max scaling for all features
*   **Training Data Features:** (List the features used for training, similar to the input list above, but ensure it matches the model's training)
*   **Target Variable:** Loan\_Status (Approved/Not Approved)

## Technical Setup (for reference)

This Space is built using:
*   **Gradio SDK:** For creating the interactive web interface.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For the machine learning model and preprocessing.
*   **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation.
*   **Python**

The core application logic is in `app.py`, and dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. The trained model is loaded from `model.pkl`.

*   `model.pkl`: The serialized, pre-trained machine learning model.
*   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies needed to run the application.

## Limitations

*   The model's predictions are based on the patterns learned from the training data and may not be 100% accurate.
*   This is a demonstration and should not be used for making real financial decisions without further validation and expert consultation.
*   The dataset used for training might have its own biases, which could be reflected in the model's predictions.
